# MBR ( Market Basket Analysis )
Market basket analysis explains the combinations of products that frequently co-occur in transactions. For example, people who buy bread and eggs, also tend to buy butter as many of them are planning to make an omelette. Marketing team should target customers who buy bread and eggs with offers on butter, to encourage them to spend more on their shopping basket.
<b>It is also known as "Affinity Analysis" or "Association Rule Mining".</b>

Association mining is usually done on transactions data from a retail market or from an online e-commerce store. Since most transactions data is large, the apriori algorithm makes it easier to find these patterns or rules quickly.
